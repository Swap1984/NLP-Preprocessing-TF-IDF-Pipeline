        "While BoW focuses purely on counting the frequency of terms, TF-IDF adjusts these counts by considering how common or rare a word is across a corpus (set of documents). This helps in down-weighting common words (like \"the\", \"is\") and emphasizing important words that are specific to a document.\n",

        "\n",
        "TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency):\n",
        "\n",
        "Purpose: Measures how important a word is in a document relative to the entire corpus.\n",
        "\n",
        "Effect: It down-weights common words (that appear in many documents) and emphasizes words that are unique to specific documents.\n",

        "**Advantages of TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Robust to Document Length:\n",
        "\n",
        "Since cosine similarity is based on the angle between vectors, it ignores document length, making it robust for comparing documents of different sizes.\n",
        "Considers Importance of Terms:\n",
        "\n",
        "TF-IDF accounts for the relative importance of terms in a document and across documents. Common words (like stop words) are down-weighted, while rare, informative words have higher impact.\n",
        "Efficient for Sparse Data:\n",
        "\n",
        "Text data is often sparse, meaning that documents share relatively few words. TF-IDF with cosine similarity efficiently handles this sparsity.\n",
        "Interpretability:\n",
        "\n",
        "TF-IDF scores are easy to interpret: they represent the importance of each word in the document relative to the corpus, while cosine similarity is straightforward in showing how similar documents are.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Disadvantages of TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Does Not Consider Word Order:\n",
        "\n",
        "Both TF-IDF and cosine similarity ignore the sequence of words (context). This means two documents that share the same words but in different orders could still be considered similar.\n",
        "No Semantic Understanding:\n",
        "\n",
        "TF-IDF treats words as independent tokens, meaning it cannot capture synonyms or other semantic relationships between words. For example, \"car\" and \"automobile\" would be treated as different terms.\n",
        "Limited for Short Texts:\n",
        "\n",
        "When working with very short documents (like tweets or single sentences), the lack of context may lead to lower quality results, since TF-IDF relies on term frequency.\n"
